# Teal Typed Template

This template provides a starting point for building applications with Teal, a typed dialect of Lua. Teal combines the simplicity and performance of Lua with static typing, offering improved code safety and tooling support. It compiles directly to Lua, allowing seamless integration with existing Lua codebases and libraries. This template includes a basic Teal process demonstrating counter functionality, showcasing how to leverage Teal's features in an AO environment.

## Features
This starter template comes with a simple Teal Counter process.
It includes a basic Teal process that increments a counter and returns the current count.

## How to build, deploy and run

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
:::warning
You will have to authenticate yourself to your aos process using a keyfile.
If you dont have the aos package alredy installed, you can run the below commands
:::
```
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```
After installation, simply run:
```
aos
```
This will setup a new keyfile for you, and then you can export it as an environment variable
```
export WALLET_JSON="$(cat ~/.aos.json)"
```
More information can be found [here](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/getting-started.html#installing-aos)

### Build the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh` executable before running the build command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh

npm run process-name:build
```

### Deploy the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh` executable before running the deploy command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh

npm run process-name:deploy
```

### Inject the process id into the frontend app

```bash
npm run process-name:inject
```

### Run the frontend app

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

:::tip
You can also deploy the frontend to permaweb using the steps on the [Permaweb Deployment](/frontend-development/permaweb-deployment)
