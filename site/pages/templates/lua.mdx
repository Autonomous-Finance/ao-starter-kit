This template provides a basic setup for developing Lua-based applications on the AO platform. It features a simple Lua Counter process that demonstrates how to create and interact with Lua processes within the AO ecosystem. The template includes both the backend Lua process and a React + Vite frontend, allowing developers to quickly start building and testing AO applications with a user-friendly interface.

## How to build, deploy and run

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
:::warning
You will have to authenticate yourself to your aos process using a keyfile.
If you dont have the aos package alredy installed, you can run the below commands
:::
```
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```
After installation, simply run:
```
aos
```
This will setup a new keyfile for you, and then you can export it as an environment variable
```
export WALLET_JSON="$(cat ~/.aos.json)"
```

:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh

npm run process-name:build
