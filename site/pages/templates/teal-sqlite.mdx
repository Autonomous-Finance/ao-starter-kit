# Teal Typed with SQLite template

This template demonstrates how to build a Teal-typed Lua process that interacts with SQLite, along with a React frontend for user interaction. Teal is a typed dialect of Lua that compiles to Lua, offering static typing and other language features while maintaining full compatibility with standard Lua.

## Features

- Lua Books Manager Process to exemplify basic CRUD operations with SQLite.
- React + Vite Frontend to interact with the process.

## How to build, deploy and run

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
:::warning
You will have to authenticate yourself to your aos process using a keyfile.
If you dont have the aos package alredy installed, you can run the below commands
:::
```
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```
After installation, simply run:
```
aos
```
This will setup a new keyfile for you, and then you can export it as an environment variable
```
export WALLET_JSON="$(cat ~/.aos.json)"
```
More information can be found [here](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/getting-started.html#installing-aos)

### Build the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh` executable before running the build command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh

npm run process-name:build
```

### Deploy the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh` executable before running the deploy command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh

npm run process-name:deploy
```

### Inject the process id into the frontend app

```bash
npm run process-name:inject
```

### Run the frontend app

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

:::tip
You can also deploy the frontend to permaweb using the steps on the [Permaweb Deployment](/frontend-development/permaweb-deployment)
